### Time Frame: 24 February 19 to 3 June 19

## R2Day1: Sunday, 24 Feb

Today starts my second round of the 100 Days of Code Challenge and for this round I'm going to do things a little bit different. First I've decided to create smaller coding goals that I plan to complete each week. On top of having weekly goals, I'm going to do annual code check ins every 30 days so that I can have a better idea of how I'm doing.

### 100 Days of Code Goals

#### Main Goals

My biggest three training goals for this second round is to:
  
  * Conmplete the Responsive Web Design and JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certifications on [freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)
  
<p align="center">

  * Complete Sections 8 to 15 in the [Zero to Mastery course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/learn/v4/content)
  
<p align="center">

## R2Day2: Monday, 25 Feb

Two days down and I'm off to a great start for my second round of 100 Days of Coding. Yesterday I spent all day writing out all of my goals for this entire round, which I'm hoping it will keep me focused and on the right track. Today I started the Applied Accessibility section and completed half of it, even though I was struggling to stay awake at work. Later when I got home, I started working on my solo project for Chingu and created my README file.

## R2Day3: Tuesday, 26 Feb

Happy to say that I finished the rest of the code challenges for the Applied Accessibility section today. After breezing thru the challenges, I went back to working on the solo project which was a little hard. I had issues trying to add a table in markdown and getting it to render correctly, however, after hours of struggling, I got it to work. Unfortunately, that wasn't the only issue that I ran into tonight. For some reason, I couldn't figure out how to add a video in markdown either. I'm proud to say that I didn't let this road block get in my way. Instead I spent hours researching my problem on Google and testing various different solutions out before finally stumbling across what I needed to make it work.
