### Time Frame: 24 February 19 to 3 June 19

## R2Day1: Sunday, 24 Feb

Today starts my second round of the 100 Days of Code Challenge and for this round I'm going to do things a little bit different. First I've decided to create smaller coding goals that I plan to complete each week. On top of having weekly goals, I'm going to do annual code check ins every 30 days so that I can have a better idea of how I'm doing.

### 100 Days of Code Goals

#### Main Goals

My biggest three training goals for this second round is to:
  
  * Conmplete the Responsive Web Design and JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certifications on [freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)
  
<p align="center">

## R2Day2: Monday, 25 Feb

Two days down and I'm off to a great start for my second round of 100 Days of Coding. Yesterday I spent all day writing out all of my goals for this entire round, which I'm hoping it will keep me focused and on the right track. Today I started the Applied Accessibility section and completed half of it, even though I was struggling to stay awake at work. Later when I got home, I started working on my solo project for Chingu and created my README file. 

<p align="center">

## R2Day3: Tuesday, 26 Feb

Happy to say that I finished the rest of the code challenges for the Applied Accessibility section today. After breezing thru the challenges, I went back to working on the solo project which was a little hard. I had issues trying to add a table in markdown and getting it to render correctly, however, after hours of struggling, I got it to work. Unfortunately, that wasn't the only issue that I ran into tonight. For some reason, I couldn't figure out how to add a video in markdown either.

I'm proud to say that I didn't let this road block get in my way. Instead I spent hours researching my problem on Google and testing various different solutions out before finally stumbling across what I needed to make it work.

## R2Day4: Wednesday, 27 Feb

<p align ="center">
  <img width="680" height="380" src="images/errors_errors.png">
</p>

Due to the fact that all of the pre-course work for the current Chingu Voyage is due in a few days, I deceided to try and knock most of it out today. Unfortunately, things didn't go as smoothly as I would have liked for them to go. While at work I decided to take a look at the [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com) challenges, but it looked liked I was trying to read Latin so I quickly turned it off. 

After that failed attempt, I decided to wait till I got home to before trying to work on the solo project. The first hour or so of me tackling the project went very smoothly, however, somewhere around the third hour things slowly took a turned for the worst. I was attempting to install Gulp on to my local computer but for some strange reason, I couldn't get it to install correctly. I spent 45 miniutes trying to find a solution to the problem, before I finally realized that I forgot to install it globaly first before trying to add it locally.  

Once I figured out that the problem I thought everything was going to be smooth sailing, boy was I dead wrong.  Apparently, my next roadblock showed up in the form of another error when I tried to add gulp-watch to the project. I was following a code tutorial step-by-step, but for some strange reason I couldn't get it to work. I spent over three hours trying to fix the problem till I just had to give up for the night. However, before I wrapped it up for the night I did send out an SOS on the Chingu Slack channel.

## R2Day5: Thursday, 28 Feb

This morning I woke up feeling very frustrated because of all the errors that I faced last night, that I didn't even bother to try to look back at my code till half the day was gone. However, when I did decide to look back at my code, I was greeted with a very nice surprise. Apparently, someone in the group took pitty on my plight and sent me a solution to my problem. 

<p align="center">
  <img width="580" height="480" src="images/solo_project_solution1a.PNG">
</p>

I was so happy when I saw that solution I almost jumped for joy. Sadly, that feeling didn't last too long because the solution only worked temporarily before I ran into another freaking error. When the new error creeped up, I almost threw my laptop across the room but I quickly thought twice about that since my laptop is practically brand new. Instead I decided to take a break from the solo project and to knock out some of the freeCodeCamp challenges that I had pending for the week.

<p align="center">
  <img width="580" height="380" src="images/codecamp_day14.PNG">
</p>

Lucky for me those remaing challenges where short and sweet and it gave me enough time to prepare for my first pair programming session. Which to be honest, a part of me was dreading the session because I was worried that my partner would be far more advanced than me and that they would be very annoyed with being paired with someone of very inferior skills. It gives me great pleasure to say that I was completely wrong about my pair programming partner. He was extremely helpful, kind, patient, and understanding during the entire hour that we spent working together. He took the time to show me the ins and out of JavaScript including how to search for things that I didn't know about. Overall it was a great ending to a stressful day full of never ending errors.

## R2Day6: Friday, 1 Mar

Even though I had a great end to a stressful day last night, I still wasn't quite ready to go back and work on the solo-project. As a substitute, I decided to tackle more of the challenges on CodeWars. Surprisingly enough, I managed to knock out four more Katas before my brain decided to stop working. Especially since I really hadn't done much work in JavaScript or played with functions and arrays before. 

<p align="center">

  <img width="580" height="380" src="images/codewars_stats.jpg">
</p>

As far as the solo-project goes, I got so frustrated with all the errors that I kept getting that I decided to delete everything that I was doing and try to do it all over again over the next couple of days. What's the main thing that's bothering me is that I just don't understand why I'm getting the errors when I'm following a tutorial step by step.

## R2Day7: Saturday, 2 Mar

#### NUMBER ONE SKILL OF PROGRAMMING

<p align="center">
  <img width="680" height="380" src="images/problem_solving.jpg">
</p>

Today I found this out the hard way. I've always known that this was a skill that I would need as a programmer, but I really didn't comprehend this till this afternoon. For the past few days, I've been using a coding tutorial to help me work on my solo project, which I've been following step by step. However, I ran into a major error that really shouldn't be happening and I just couldn't figure it out. It took me about four long and gruelling days of searching the web for various solutions to my problem. Everytime I came across a possible fix to the problem, I would test it out in my code only to have it break once again. 

I swear I went thru this process about 60 to 70 times before I stumbled across the fix that I was looking for. As it turns out, one of the files that I had downloaded for my solo project was a different version from the one in the tutorial. In addition, alot of the features in the older version that the tutorial was using had become obsolete. This  meant that if I wanted to use those features in my project, which I did, I would have to add the older version to project. Once I switched versions, everything began to run smoothly again. 

## R2Day8: Sunday, 3 Mar

</p>

I really believe that I showed great **Perseverance** these past few days due to the fact that I didn't just throw in the towel after encountering that silly little error. Instead I kept searching and searching and searching till I found the right solution to fixing my broken code. Now that I've cleared that hurdle, I can focus on adding the HTML to my project and write awesome CSS!!!

## R2Day9: Monday, 4 Mar to R2Day100+: Wednesday. 26 Jun

</p>

I had hoped that this round would be a little different but unfortunately I got distracted again by the chaos that is my life and failed to keep things going liked I had originally planned. Well in all honestly, I did manage to code for a few days here and there, but I totally forgot to keep track of what I was doing. It pains me to say that in all of that time, I still haven't mananged to complete any of the projects that I was working on nor any of the courses that I was taking. Well this round has long come to an end and here's hoping that I can do better and not get distracted in the next round of coding.
