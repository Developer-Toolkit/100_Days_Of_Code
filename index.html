      <h2 class="section_title">Day 1 Week 1:</h2>
      <p>Today I took my first step down the road to becoming a Node.js Developer even though I didn't really do any actual coding. Instead of sitting down and trying to code like a mad kitty I decided to come up with a plan of attack for this journey. So I created a new GitHub Repo called Zero to Mastery. After creating the repo I worked on the readme file and established a learn to code curriculm which included a six-week plan of attack.</p>

      <p>Before the day ended I did find the time to review the first section of the Zero to Mastery course which was mainly an overview of the course and community that's been built. Speaking of the community I had no idea how popular I would be. I posted a message in the programming-buddies channel basically saying that I'm new to the course and was looking for a programming wingman to travel down this path of learning with me. I wasn't really expecting to get a response from anyone, but within eight hours I didn't just get one wingman but three. After the second potential wingman hit me up I decided that it would be awesome if we all formed a small coding group to help us ease on down the road.</p>

      <p>Saying that out loud makes me feel like Dorothy from THE WIZ (the best version of the Wizard of OZ)!!!</p>

      <h2 class="section_title">Day 2 Week 1:</h2>
      <p>So today I didn't do any real new coding. That being said, I still was busy coding because I spent most of my time coding my Day 1 Week 1 experience. It sucks that I'm behind on my days but I'm not so far behind that I can't catch up. I have say that it's good that I'm doing this challenge because every day I'm coding something regardless if I've fallen behind on learning something new or not. However, I don't want to get to far behind since I'm the lead developer for my coding group.</p>

      <h2 class="section_title">Day 3 Week 1:</h2>
      <p>I'm really happy to say that today was a very productive day for me. I finished the following sections in my Zero to Mastery course.</p>

      <p>Doing two sections in one day might not seem like much but believe me it's a big deal for someone like me who loves to procrastinate and who have the attention span of a <img src="images/distracted_cat.gif" alt="Distracted Cat">. So for me to find the focus to sit down and knock out those two sections in one sitting is awesome.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Even though that I manaaged to complete these two sections in one day, it's not the biggest thing that I did today. I'm really excited that created my first GitHub organization page called <strong>Rising Phoenix 81</strong> <img src="images/rising_phoenix2.jpg" alt="Org Logo">. Then I created my first team page for my new coding buddies and myself to showcase the team projects that we're going to create.</p>
