      <p>Today I took my first step down the road to becoming a Node.js Developer even though I didn't really do any actual coding. Instead of sitting down and trying to code like a mad kitty I decided to come up with a plan of attack for this journey. So I created a new GitHub Repo called Zero to Mastery. After creating the repo I worked on the readme file and established a learn to code curriculm which included a six-week plan of attack.</p>

      <p>Before the day ended I did find the time to review the first section of the Zero to Mastery course which was mainly an overview of the course and community that's been built. Speaking of the community I had no idea how popular I would be. I posted a message in the programming-buddies channel basically saying that I'm new to the course and was looking for a programming wingman to travel down this path of learning with me. I wasn't really expecting to get a response from anyone, but within eight hours I didn't just get one wingman but three. After the second potential wingman hit me up I decided that it would be awesome if we all formed a small coding group to help us ease on down the road.</p>
      
      <p>Saying that out loud makes me feel like Dorothy from THE WIZ (the best version of the Wizard of OZ)!!!</p>
