</p>
Today I took my first step down the road to becoming a Node.js Developer even though I didn't really do any actual coding. Instead of sitting down and trying to code like a mad kitty I decided to come up with a plan of attack for this journey. So I created a new GitHub repo called Zero to Mastery. After creating the repo I worked on the Readme.md file and established a "Learn-to-Code" Curriculum which included a six-week plan of attack.

</p>
Before the day ended I did find the time to review the first section of the Zero to Mastery course which was mainly an overview of the course and community that's been built.  Speaking of the community I had no idea how popular I would be. I posted a message in the programming-buddies channel basically saying that I'm new to the course and was looking for a programming wingman to travel down this path of learning with me. I wasn't really expecting to get a response from anyone, but within eight hours I didn't just get one wingman but three. After the second potential wingman hit me up I decided that it would be awesome if we all formed a small coding group to help us ease on down the road.

Saying that out loud makes me feel like Dorothy from THE WIZ (the best version of the Wizard of OZ)!!!

## R1Day2: 2 Nov 18, Friday
So today I didn't spend any time doing any actual coding, however, I was still busy coding because I spent most of my time coding my Day 1 experience. It sucks that I'm behind on my days but I'm not so far behind that I can't catch up. I have to say that it's good that I'm doing this challenge because every day I'm coding something regardless if I've fallen behind on learning something new or not. However, I don't want to get to far behind since I'm the lead developer for my coding group.

## R1Day3: 3 Nov 18, Saturday
I'm really happy to say that today was a very productive day for me. I finished the following sections in my Zero to Mastery course:

Doing two sections in one day might not seem like much but believe me it's a big deal for someone like me who loves to procrastinate and who have the attention span of a:

</p>
So for me to find the focus to sit down and knock out those two sections in one sitting is awesome.

Even though I managed to complete these two setions in one day, it's not the biggest thing that I did today. I'm really excited that I created my first Github organization page called **Rising Phoenix 81**.
<p align="center">

Then I created my first team page for my coding buddies and myself to showcase the team projects that we're going to create.

## R1Day4: 4 Nov 18, Sunday
Today I didn't wear my coder hat till it was almost time for me to go to bed. Instead I decided to put on the hat of a team leader and give my new coding buddies a small challenge in using Git and GitHub. I asked them to do the following:
<p align="center">

</p>
Once everyone had a chance to work on the assignment I went back to review everyone's GitHub repos and offer any feedback to help them improve them.
<p align="center">

</p>
I have to admit that it was kind of fun to put on the team leader hat and it was really nice to see that my feedback was well received by my teammates. I'm really happy to be working with a great bunch of gryphons who are excited and dedicated to becoming a software developer like me. Speaking of becoming a software developer I did manage to do a little bit of code review before calling it quits for the day. I started to review the second part of the Lambda School precourse work for the upcoming online bootcamp session. Which reminds me that I have to finish it all, plus the interview before 19 Nov 18. Talk about pressure, but it's not like this

## R1Day5: 5 Nov 18, Monday
Fifth day into this 100 day challenge and I'm still easing down the road with my coding buddies. While my team worked on creating their GitHub repos for the 100 Days of Code challenge, I deceided to tackle the second portion of the Lambda School precourse work. This time we reviewed HTML and CSS fundamentals.

After crusing through the review I completed tow of the projects for the lesson.

Six more sections to do before I can sit down for my interview with Lambda School and do the code challenge.

## R1Day6: 6 Nov 18, Tuesday
Well have to say that things didn't go so well for me today. I got distracted by the 2018 Midterm Elections and all of the news cast surrounding all of that. Even though I was distracted I was able to work on the first half of the third exercise for lesson 2 of the precourse work.

## R1Day7: 7 Nov 18, Wedesday
Seven days down and thus marks the end of my first week. Unfortunately, I didn't end the week as strong as I would have liked. I was tired and depressed by the results of the 2018 Midterm Elections so I didn't have the energy to code a lot. I barely had enough energy to finish the second half of the third exercise from lesson 2. Oh well, it is what it is and tomorrow is a brand new day.

## R1Day8: 8 Nov 18, Thursday
At this moment in time I haven't sat down and done any new coding because I was still a little tired and distracted. So I'm going to use today as a day of reflection and look back at the things that I've done for the week. This week I took the first step towards becoming a Software Developer by creating a game plan and coming up with some goals that I wanted to accomplish within the next few months.

After creating the game plan I started with the Zero to Mastery course where I started a coding group and took on the role of team lead. I have to admit that taking on this new role was totally unexpected because I had originally planned on just doing the course all by myself, but I'm glad that I'm not. At the same time, I decided to complete Lambda School precourse work for the upcoming online bootcamp session. So far I've completed two out of the eight sections of the precourse work.

Overall, I have to say that the past seven days have been very good and productive even though I was a little distracted the past two days. Before I close this day out I wanted to take a moment to share a glimpse at the amount of time that I've spent coding this week. I've been using the WakaTime app which is committed to making time tracking fully automatic for every programmer.

## R1Day9: 9 Nov 18, Friday
**YIPPIE!!!** I've reached the ninth day of my challenge and despite a few minor distractions I haven't given up. Better yet I've moved on to learning new stuff, well not exactly. I completed the Section 4 of the ZTM course which basically was an introduction of HTML 5. Since I've practically been trying to become a Software Developer off and on for the past two years I pretty much already knew about HTML 5. So today was basically a refresher course of HTML 5 which discussed the basic tags and elements of HTML.

## R1Day10: 10 Nov 18, Saturday

When I went to bed this morning around 1:45am, I thought that I would get a good nights rest so that I could wake up later in the day and finish reviewing Section 5 of the ZTM course that I started on before I finally gave into the sandman's spell. However, when I woke up a few hours later around noon, my body and mind had other desires. I got out of bed, walked to the living room and plopped into my gaming chair and never got up. I grabbed my PS4 controller and played video games all day and night. If it wasn't for me treating this challenge like a daily journal I probably wouldn't be coding right now. Oh well, like I told one of my teammates when he mentioned that our group was awfully quite today, We all need a day of rest once in awhile and I guess today was mine.

## R1Day11: 11 Nov 18, Sunday
<p align="center">

</p>
Now that my lazy day has come and gone I've decided that the best way to get back into the swing of things would be to review the next module of the precourse work from Lambda School. So today I took my first inital look at JavaScript and to be honest I felt a little bit intimidated. In the past when I would try to learn how to code, I would learn everything about HTML & CSS, but never anything past that point. It seemed like everytime I got close to learning more I kept hitting a brick wall and I couldn't get over it. However, this time around I'm going to meet that brick wall head on and knock it down!!!

## R1Day12: 12 Nov 18, Monday
<p align="center">

</p>
Today I really felt like a real big imopostor when I tried to complete the code review for the Introduciton to JavaScript module. The review had at least ten basic exercise questions that I needed to answer, however, on my first attempt I barely answered three of the questions. I had no clue how to answer the other seven questions and when I tried to Google them I wasn't able to find any answers because I really didn't know what questions to look up. I stared at my computers for hours with a very dumbfound look on my face because I really didn't know what to do or how to begin. When hour number five rolled around I finally just turned my computer off and watched tv. I have to keep telling myself that tomorrow is a brand new day and another chance to try it again.
