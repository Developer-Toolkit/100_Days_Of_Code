At the same time, I'm going to apply to the Lambda School Full-Stack Web & Computer Science BootCamp course. I'm hoping that I get in so that I can add another sense of structure to my learning program. In addition, I going to take part in the 30 Days, 30 Website Challenge!!!

I know it sounds like a lot of stuff to accomplish in 100 days but I'm so ready to get started and to change my life for the better!!!
