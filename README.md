I have to admit that when I first attempted to code I really didn't believe in myself or what I was attempting to do. I really felt like a hampster in a cage who kept running and running on that wheel but wasn't getting anywhere fast. Eventually, I got so feed up with not making any headway, I just decided to quite all together and just play video games for the rest of my life. Lucky for me I'm very stubborn, pig headed and it takes a while before I really give up something. I know that if I really apply myself and put in the hardwork I eventually can become a Software Developer and change my life for the better. 

So to help me get where I want to be, I've decided that I'm going to do the 100 Days of Code Challange and I'm actually going to finish it this time. I may have tried to do this once or twice in the past but for various reasons I never really came close to actually finishing the challenge. However, this time I know that I'm going to finish the challenge this time because I finally took the time to:
* Identify my Goals
* Create a Plan
* Determine the underlining reasons behind me doing the challenge

## My Goals
* **Become a Node Js Developer**
* **Stop Procrastinating**
* Complete two to three courses on https://www.udemy.com
* **Stop Procrastinating**
* Learn JavaScript
* Get more comfortable with PostCSS
* Learn to write clean code
* **Stop Procrastinating**

# Additional Rules
  * I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysofCode on all of my social media accounts.
  * I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
  * I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others see my progress.
