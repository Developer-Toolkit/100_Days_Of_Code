A visual journal of my coding journey.

Even though I've been trying to learn to code (on and off) for the past two years. I've decided that I'm going to do the 100 Days of Code Challange and I'm actually going to finish it this time. I may have tried to do this once or twice in the past but for various reasons I never really came close to actually finishing the challenge. However, this time I know that I'm going to finish the challenge this time because I finally took the time to:
* Identify my Goals
* Create a Plan
* Determine the underlining reasons behind me doing the challenge

## My Goals
* **Become a Node Js Developer**
* **Stop Procrasting**
* Complete three courses on https://www.udemy.com
* Earn the Microsoft Professional Program Certificate in Front-End Web Development from https://www.edx.org/microsoft-professional-program-front-end-development ![Microsoft Cert PNG](images/microsoft_cert.png)
* **Stop Procrasting**
* Learn JavaScript
* Get more comfortable with PostCSS
* Learn to write clean code
* **Stop Procrasting**

## My Plan
### Goal: Become a Node Js Developer
