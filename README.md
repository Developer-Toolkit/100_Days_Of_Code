I have to admit that when I first attempted to code I really didn't believe in myself or what I was attempting to do. I really felt like a hampster in a cage who kept running and running on that wheel but wasn't getting anywhere fast. Eventually, I got so feed up with not making any headway, I just decided to quite all together and just play video games for the rest of my life. Lucky for me I'm very stubborn, pig headed and it takes a while before I really give up something. I know that if I really apply myself and put in the hardwork I eventually can become a Software Developer and change my life for the better. 

So to help me get where I want to be, I've decided that I'm going to do the 100 Days of Code Challange and I'm actually going to finish it this time. I may have tried to do this once or twice in the past but for various reasons I never really came close to actually finishing the challenge. However, this time I know that I'm going to finish the challenge this time because I finally took the time to:
* Identify my Goals
* Create a Plan
* Determine the underlining reasons behind me doing the challenge

## My Goals
* **Become a Node Js Developer**
* **Stop Procrastinating**
* Complete two to three courses on https://www.udemy.com
* **Stop Procrastinating**
* Learn JavaScript
* Get more comfortable with PostCSS
* Learn to write clean code
* **Stop Procrastinating**

## Massive Open Online Cources (MOOCs)
There's so many different training and video tutorials out there all designed to help a person become a better developer that it can be hard to determine which tutorials to use. It doesn't help either that I have the attention span of a

So I get distracted very easily by all the different resources out there. After months of constantly bouncing around from tutorial to tutortial I finally decdided which ones I wanted to use to help me reach my goals.

At the same time, I'm going to apply to apply to Lambda School Full-Stack Web & Computer Science BootCamp course. I'm hoping that I get in so that I can add another sense of structure to my learning program. In addition, I going to take part in the 30 Days, 30 Website Challenge!!!

I know it sounds like a lot of stuff to accomplish in 100 days but I'm so ready to get started and to change my life for the better!!!
