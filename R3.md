### Time Frame: 26 June 2019 to 4 October 2019

## R3Day1: Wednesday - 26 June

Due to the fact that I really didn't accomplish any of my goals from Round 2, I'm going to keep them the same for this round with a few tweaks here and there.

Today starts my third round of the 100 Days of Code Challenge and for this round I'm going to do things a little bit different. First I've decided to create smaller coding goals that I plan to complete each week. On top of having weekly goals, I'm going to do annual code check ins every 30 days so that I can have a better idea of how I'm doing.

### 100 Days of Code Goals

#### Main Goals

My biggest three training goals for this second round is to:
  
  * Conmplete the Responsive Web Design and JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certifications on [freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)
