### Time Frame: 26 June 2019 to 4 October 2019

## R3Day1: Wednesday - 26 June

Due to the fact that I really didn't accomplish any of my goals from Round 2, I'm going to keep them the same for this round with a few tweaks here and there.

Today starts my third round of the 100 Days of Code Challenge and for this round I'm going to do things a little bit different. First I've decided to create smaller coding goals that I plan to complete each week. On top of having weekly goals, I'm going to do annual code check ins every 30 days so that I can have a better idea of how I'm doing.

### 100 Days of Code Goals

#### Main Goals

My biggest three training goals for this second round is to:
  
  * Conmplete the Responsive Web Design and JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certifications on [freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)
  
<p align="center">

## R3D2: Thursday - 27 Jun

<p align="center">

</p>

So today I decided to the Zero to Master course all over again and reviewed Sections 1 to 4 which basically covered the history of the internet and basic HTML.

</p>

After I finished working on the Zero to Master course, I decided to work on the [sample portfolio website](https://github.com/dreampoetlee/Portfolio-Website-Sample) that I'm building from scratch thanks to the help of Kevin Powell's YouTube series called [Design A Portfolio Website with Adobe XD](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4-IK0AVhVjOxfIIsdVlIKfKinHDB0qDR).

## R3D3: Friday - 28 Jun

<p align="center">

</p>

Didn't get a chance to do any coding today due to work being so hectic and I recieved some really interesting news before the day ended. Don't want to say what that news was at this moment till everything becomes official. All I can say right now is that this news will be a big game changer for me and I can't wait.

## R3D4: Saturday - 29 Jun

I have to say, today was a very productive day for me. I spent all morning working on the sample portfolio website that I've been building. My main focus for today was adding the final text to the **Intro** section and including both the **About Me** &amp; **My Work** sections to the website.

## R3D5: Sunday - 30 June

After watching the new YouTube video [Self Taught vs BootCamp vs College](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAlwZe-UrDY) posted by [Joshua Fluke](https://www.youtube.com/user/Tychos1) where he compared the difference between each options, I decided that even though being a self taught developer

<p align="center">
  <img width="580" height="280" src="images/R3-images/self-taught-developer.png" alt="Self Taught Developer">
</p>

might have been a great idea for me, especially a less costly one. However, it might not have been the overall best option for me considering the fact that it lacks the structure that I so desperately need in order for me to become a Full Stack Developer. So in order to get the structure that I truly feel that I need I'm going to attend Lambda School Coding Bootcamp. However, before I can get in I need to complete the Web Development Precourse work, which I started working on today. The work consists of nine different sections and I was able to complete three of those sections today. I plan to complete the rest of the sections by the end of next week for sure.
